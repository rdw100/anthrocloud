# AnthroCloud
This is source code for a capstone project.  The second semester capstone course research topic is Software Modernization for Cloud-based Pediatric Anthropometry.  The software is called AnthroCloud.  This project will create a modern cloud-based WHO 2006 Child Growth Standard-compliant anthropometric calculator designed to provide a more flexible, maintainable, and portable solution to meet the changing needs of users.

## Project

### Schedule & Timeline
The Microsoft Project plan included WBS outline and Gantt chart to visualize tasks.  Sections of work contain tasks and sub-tasks necessary to complete deliverables for this project.  Completion milestones are highlighted by a bold end date.

### Process Template
The WBS and Gantt chart for this project was created in Microsoft Project and published to Azure Board as a backlog.  The Agile Process Template available in Azure Boards was used.  Five sprint iterations produced five epics.

### Technique
A forward engineering effort building software from a high-level view of existing software was used.
AnthroCloud expands beyond the original program's capabilities.
Reverse engineering tools are used for limited interface & design discovery.
Interfaces are created to separate layers one at a time.
A bottom-up horizontal strategy is used create a newly designed, coded, and tested program.
Product assembly from larger to smaller composition is illustrated.

## Design
The section lays out technical design used to create the AnthroCloud solution.

### Architecture
The solution conforms to the architectural design below.  The solution will not compile if a dependency violation exists.  Arrows between components are read as “Uses” statements.  No single upstream component can perform an End-Run and circumvent the architecture without breaking the build.  For example, presentation layer cannot access the data layer directly.  This ensures the software is consistent with the intended design and meets requirements.

### Physical
The physical view of the software is represented as a deployment diagram.  The web application is rendered to the client’s web browser over HTTP.  Requests pass through the web application, then web service and finally the database. The deployment diagram identifies the elements comprising the physical view of the system.

 ### Rationale
 Layered architectural and interactive system patterns were selected for the design.  The table below describes technology by layer used for the AnthroCloud software solution.
 
 | Layer         | Technologies                                                  |
 | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
 | Presentation	 | .NET Core, Blazor Server App, ASP.NET Core MVC, Google Charts, HTML5, Javascript
 | Service	     | ASP.NET Core Web API |
 | Business	     | C# |
 | Data	         | Entity Framework Core |
 | Database	     | Azure SQL Database |

### Rest API
The AnthroCloud RESTful API is designed to support retrieval operations.  The REST guidelines in Table 11 suggest HTTP calls to make to the server.  The calls are safe as they do not change the state of data.

 | Resource Type | HTTP Verb | Resource API	                      | Description                                             |
